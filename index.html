            <h3><i>What is Game of Life?</i></h3>
            <p>The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.</p> 
                <p>It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.</p>
                <p>One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.</p>
                <p>It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine.</p>
